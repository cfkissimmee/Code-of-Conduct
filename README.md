Code for Kissimmee Code of Conduct

_The Code of Conduct may be updated or changed without prior notice at the Brigade Captain's discretion. The most current version of the Code of Conduct is found at https://github.com/cfkissimmee/Code-of-Conduct. When determining current requirements, you should always access the current online version, and not rely on earlier versions._

The Code for Kissimmee Code of Conduct is one of the ways we put Code for Kissimmee’s values into practice. It’s built around the recognition that everything we do in connection with our work at Code for Kissimmee will be, and should be, measured against the highest possible standards of ethical conduct. We set the bar that high for practical as well as aspirational reasons: Our commitment to the highest standards helps us recruit great people, build great solutions, and attract government and community partners. Respect for our users, for the opportunity, and for each other are foundational to our success, and are something we need to support every day.
So please do read the Code for Kissimmee’s values, and follow both in spirit and letter, always bearing in mind that each of us has a personal responsibility to incorporate, and to encourage other Brigadeers to incorporate, the principles of the Code and values into our work. And if you have a question or ever think that one of your fellow Brigadeers or the Brigade as a whole may be falling short of our commitment, don’t be silent. We want – and need – to hear from you.
# Who Must Follow Our Code?
We expect all of our Brigadeer and Brigade Leadership to know and follow the Code. Failure to do so can result in disciplinary action, including expulsion from all Brigade Activities (present and future). Moreover, while the Code is specifically written for Code for Kissimmee Brigadeers and Leadership, we expect Code for Kissimmee contractors, consultants, and others who may be temporarily assigned to perform work or services for Code for Kissimmee to follow the Code in connection with their work for us. Failure of a Code for Kissimmee contractor, consultant, or other covered service provider to follow the Code can result in termination of their relationship with Code for Kissimmee.

# I. Serve Our Users
Our users value Code for Kissimmee not only because we deliver great products and services, but because we hold ourselves to a higher standard in how we treat users and operate more generally. Keeping the following principles in mind will help us to maintain that high standard:
- ## 1.	Integrity
Our reputation as a volunteer group that our users can trust is our most valuable asset, and it is up to all of us to make sure that we continually earn that trust. All of our communications and other interactions with our users should increase their trust in us.
- ## 2.	Usefulness
Our products, features, and services should make Code for Kissimmee more useful for all our users. We have many different types of users, from nonprofits to government agencies, but one guiding principle: “Is what we are offering useful?”
- ## 3.	Privacy, Security, and Freedom of Expression
Always remember that we are asking users to trust us with their personal information. Preserving that trust requires that each of us respect and protect the privacy and security of that information. Our security procedures strictly limit access to and use of users’ personal information, and require that each of us take measures to protect user data from unauthorized access. Know your responsibilities under these procedures, and collect, use, and access user personal information only as authorized by our Security Policies, our Privacy Policies, and applicable data protection laws.
Code for Kissimmee is committed to advancing privacy and freedom of expression for our users around our community. Where user privacy and freedom of expression face government challenges, we seek to implement internationally recognized standards that respect those rights as we develop products, do business in diverse markets, and respond to government requests to access user information or remove user content.
- ## 4.	Responsiveness
Part of being useful and honest is being responsive: We recognize relevant user feedback when we see it, and we do something about it. We take pride in responding to communications from our users, whether questions, problems, or compliments. If something is broken, fix it.
- ## 5.	Take Action
Any time you feel our users aren’t being well-served, don’t be bashful - let someone in the Brigade know about it. Continually improving our products and services takes all of us, and we’re proud that Brigadeers champion our users and take the initiative to step forward when the interests of our users are at stake.
# II. Support Each Other
We are committed to a supportive environment, where Brigadeers have the opportunity to reach their fullest potential. Brigadeers are expected to do their utmost to create a culture that is free of harassment, intimidation, bias, and unlawful discrimination.
- ## 1.	Equal Opportunity
We strictly prohibit unlawful discrimination or harassment on the basis of race, color, religion, veteran status, national origin, ancestry, pregnancy status, sex, gender identity or expression, age, marital status, mental or physical disability, medical condition, sexual orientation, or any other characteristics protected by law. We also make all reasonable accommodations to meet our obligations under laws protecting the rights of the disabled.
- ## 2.	Harassment, Discrimination, and Bullying
Code for Kissimmee prohibits discrimination, harassment and bullying in any form – verbal, physical, or visual, as discussed more fully in our Anti-Harassment Policy found here -> _https://github.com/cfkissimmee/Anti-Harassment-Policy_. If you believe you’ve been bullied or harassed by anyone at Code for Kissimmee, or by a Code for Kissimmee partner or vendor, we strongly encourage you to immediately report the incident to Brigade Leadership at **harassment@codeforkissimmee.org**, and leadership will promptly and thoroughly investigate any complaints and take appropriate action.
- ## 3.	Drugs and Alcohol
Our position on substance abuse is simple: It is incompatible with the health and safety of our Brigadeers, and we don’t permit it. Consumption of alcohol is not banned at our socials, but use good judgment and never drink in a way that leads to impaired performance or inappropriate behavior, endangers the safety of others, or violates the law. Illegal drugs at our socials, meetings, or at sponsored events are strictly prohibited. If leadership has reasonable suspicion to believe that a Brigadeer’s use of drugs and/or alcohol may adversely affect the Brigadeer’s safety or the safety of others in or out of the Brigade, leadership may request for the Brigadeer to leave the event, and if abuse is habitual, expulsion from all current and future events may occur. A reasonable suspicion may be based on objective symptoms such as the Brigadeer’s appearance, behavior, or speech.
- ## 4.	Safety
We are committed to a violence-free environment, and we will not tolerate any level of violence or the threat of violence. Under no circumstances should anyone bring a weapon to any events where it is a direct violation of the venue’s posted weapon policy. If you become aware of a violation of this policy, you should report it to **violation@codeforkissimmee.org**
